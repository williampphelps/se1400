            <h2>Competition</h2>
            <h4>Who is my competition?</h4>
            <p>I would say that my competition is other Full-Stack Developers in the Southern Utah area.</p>
            <h4>What is the competition doing right?</h4>
            <p>The better portfolios that I have seen are minimilistic and have good design. They are easy to navigate and have images that showcase their work.</p>
            <h4>What is the competition doing wrong?</h4>
            <p>Some of the portfolios I have looked at are difficult to navigate. The flashiness of the different effects take precedence over their content making it difficult to discern what they have done. A lot of portfolios lack images of their design work. </p>
            <h4>How can I do it better?</h4>
            <p>I can make sure that I have clear navigation that is intuitive. I can include screenshots/images/videos of my projects. I can make sure that the fun effects aren't too overwhelming.</p>
